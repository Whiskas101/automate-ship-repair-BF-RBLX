Simplifies a mundane minigame, that shouldn't exist.

(A failed attempt, leading to less HP gain and a net loss over traditional repair method.)

To run:
  - Install Python
  - run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - Once finished, double click main.py
  - Pressing `-` pauses the app, pressing `=` closes the app.

To Do:
  - Look into a executable distribution for easier use
  - Lesser CPU usage (currently takes about 3-4%)
